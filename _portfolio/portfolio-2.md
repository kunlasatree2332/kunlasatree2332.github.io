The Kaggle Python course, I gained hands-on experience with core Python programming concepts used in data science. I learned how to work with variables, numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries, write and use functions, apply boolean logic and conditional statements, and debug code using Python’s built-in help tools. This course strengthened my problem-solving skills and prepared me for more advanced topics such as Pandas, machine learning, and data analysis.
