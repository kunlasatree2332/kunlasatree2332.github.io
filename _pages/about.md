I am Kunlasatree Srinalchan (Whipcream), a junior Geoscience student at Mahidol University with a growing interest in geophysics and subsurface analysis. I am passionate about understanding Earth processes and exploring how geoscience can be applied to energy, environmental solutions, and future technologies.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in various activities such as the Thailand Earth Science Olympiad, PTTEP educational programs, and university conferences. These experiences have strengthened my skills in communication, teamwork, leadership, and analytical thinking.

I am a dedicated and adaptable learner who enjoys taking on new challenges and continuously improving myself. I look forward to opportunities in geoscience research, energy resources, and Earth science–related projects, where I can contribute my potential and continue building my professional path.
